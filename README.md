# DiceGame
This program plays a simple dice game between the computer and the user. When the program runs, a loop should repeat 10 times. As the loop iterates, the program counts the number of times the computer wins and the number of times the user wins.  After the loop performs 10 iterations, the program displays the number of times that each player (computer and user) wins and who was the grand winner.
